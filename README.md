### ABOUT
This app enables users to enter their yard area, and see similar sized yards that a green company has worked on. The similar yards are within 1000 square feet of the yard size typed in. Additionally, the pictures show a before and after for full effect.

The yard area would ideally pull from the Measur.it tool, and then show filtered results, but without access to that I created this as a demonstration.
